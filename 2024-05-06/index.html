            The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes
            Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble
            on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes
            tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of
            years. Orbit and Rotation Rings Moons Formation Structure Surface
            Water on the Moon Atmosphere Magnetosphere The Moon was likely
            formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion
            years ago. Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the
            Moon" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo
            Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. In Latin,
            the Moon was called Luna, which is the main adjective for all things
            Moon-related: lunar. With a radius of about 1,080 miles (1,740
            kilometers), the Moon is less than a third of the width of Earth. If
            Earth were the size of a nickel, the Moon would be about as big as a
            coffee bean. The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400
            kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in
            between Earth and the Moon. The Moon is slowly moving away from
            Earth, getting about an inch farther away each year.
